"""[dgxarley] CUTLASS DSL mma.py: add sm_120a + sm_121a to BlockScaledMmaOp.admissible_archs.

Patch CUTLASS BlockScaledMmaOp to support SM121 (DGX Spark GB10) for FP4 operations.
Upstream CUTLASS restricts FP4 tensor ops to sm_100a only (issue NVIDIA/cutlass#2800).
SM121 has native FP4 Tensor Core support but is not in admissible_archs, so the
JIT-compiled nvfp4_blockwise_moe kernel falls back to an incompatible code path and
trips a device-side assert.
Fix: add sm_120a + sm_121a to admissible_archs in both CUTLASS DSL copies.
External validation: BTankut/dgx-spark-sglang-moe-configs achieved 356 TFLOPS NVFP4 on GB10.

Targets are NOT under sglang: CUTLASS DSL ships in two places and either may be the
one the JIT actually loads, so both get patched when present:
  1. nvidia_cutlass_dsl/...  (the standalone wheel)
  2. flashinfer/data/cutlass/...  (the copy bundled inside flashinfer)
On the 0.5.15-sm121 image only copy 2 exists.

Two deliberate deviations from the original bash, both documented rather than silent:

* A MISSING copy is not an error. The original only warned when NEITHER copy was
  found, and said nothing about a single missing one. A plain Patch() per path would
  print "target file missing" ANCHOR-DRIFT for the absent nvidia_cutlass_dsl copy on
  every boot, which is noise, not drift. So the paths are filtered by existence first
  and the "neither found" warning is kept verbatim.
* The original's outer guard grepped `admissible_archs = [` and then sed-replaced
  `Arch.sm_100a,`. If the former existed but the latter did not, sed silently changed
  nothing while still logging "Patched". Here the replaced text IS the anchor, so that
  case now reports ANCHOR-DRIFT instead of lying. Same tree, better diagnostic.

replace_all: the original used `sed -i 's/Arch\\.sm_100a,/.../'`, which substitutes the
first match on EVERY line, not just the first in the file. The pristine image has
exactly 1 occurrence, so this is equivalent today, but replace_all is what sed meant.

Re-sync: drop this file once CUTLASS admits sm_121a upstream (the sm_121a marker guard
makes it a no-op then).
